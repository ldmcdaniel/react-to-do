This is an HTML parser that will generate a list of links contained in the HTML returned from fetching a URL.  
The URL I used to test that this project is working correctly is:
`https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/myemma.com`

To install the project, download the repo (fork or clone it) and from the root folder of the project, run `npm install`.
To view the project locally, run `npm start`. 
Your browser should open a new connection on `localhost:3000` and you should see the form to enter the url.
Enter `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/myemma.com` in the form to see my html parser in action.
